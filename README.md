### Yo 🙌

I am a mountain lover. Nature is what makes me fell happy and mountains are my friend. Apart from that, I am a software engineer with ~10 years of experience (both commercial and freelance) always trying to simplify the process and things in general as much as possible, to keep the proper focus and momentum.
